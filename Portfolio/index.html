        <p><b>Application Development For Library Management:</b><br>
            This project involves developing a library management<br>
             system website and subsequently converting it into a<br>
             mobile app. The web platform enables efficient library<br>
              operations, including book cataloging, user management.<br>
               The transition to a mobile app  enhances accessibility <br>
               and user convenience. After successful development, the <br>
            app is launched on the Google Play Store.<br><br>
            Tools Used: Visual studio code, Android studio, Flutter</p>

    <div class="box2">
        <p><b>Webpage development for government school :</b><br>
            Enhance educational outreach and accessibility for government
             schools through the development of an inclusive and user
             friendly webpage. Foster seamless communication between 
             stakeholders, streamline information dissemination, and
             promote transparency. Prioritize user experience, ensuring
              the website serves as a centralized hub for resources, <
            announcements, and  interactive tools, fostering a digitally 
            empowered educational community.<br><br>

        <p><b>Smart Attendance System Using Machine Learning :</b></br>
            The objective is to automate attendance tracking 
            through real-time video streaming and machine learning. 
            This system employs  a camera to capture live video, a
             face detection module to locate faces, and a pre-trained 
             recognition model for identification.  With an attendance 
             database and user interface, it ensures efficient logging and monitoring.</br></br>
            Tools Used : Matlab</p>

    <div class="box4">
        <p><b>Lung Cancer Detection Using Artificial Intelligence </b><br>
            This project leverages machine learning, particularly
             convolutional neural networks, to analyze medical imaging 
             data, specifically CT scans, for early detection of lung 
             cancer. By training the model on labeled datasets and 
             collaborating with healthcare experts, the goal is to 
             create a reliable tool for identifying potential cancerous 
            nodules, contributing to improved diagnosis and treatment 
            outcomes.<br><br>
